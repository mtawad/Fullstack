            Arsenal comfortably cruise past The Bees this weekend. Arsenal had started the weekend 
            top of the table <br> but dropped to third after Manchester City and Tottenham won on Saturday.
            This win, however, put the <br> Gunners on 18 points, one more than their nearest rivals before 
            their next match against Spurs in the north <br> London derby at Emirates Stadium on 1 October (12:30 BST).

            Atletico Madrid vs Real Madrid
        </h4>
        <p>
            In a very lively derby, Real Madrid beat Atletico Madrid to carry their winning form to
            6 wins from 6 at <br> the start of their La Liga title defence. However, the fixture was
            marred by what had appeared to be racist <br> chants aimed at Real's Brazilian forward Vinicius 
            outside the stadium beforehand, which followed criticism <br> of his dancing goal celebrations 
            and a debate over wether that criticism was racist.

            Lionel Messi scored the winner as Paris St-Germain beat Lyon to maintain their unbeaten start to 
            Ligue 1 <br> and move two points clear at the top of the table.Messi found the net inside five minutes 
            with a smart <br> first-time finish after combining with Neymar, who made his seventh assist in the league
            this term. PSG <br> 
            now hold a two-point lead over Marseille, who are also yet to lose a game this season.
