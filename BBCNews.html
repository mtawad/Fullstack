            <h2>Wow.</h2>
                <p>A BIG political moment.
                    <br><br>
                    For something that wasn't even technically a Budget, it was one heck of a statement ofvintent from the new prime minister and new chancellor.
                    <br><br>
                    And it is a gamble.
                    <br><br>
                    A massive leap in a new direction.
                    <br><br>
                    It amounts to the wholesale shredding of previous economic policy: both the ones adopted by Conservative governments over the last 12 years (which Liz Truss sat within for most of that time) and those of Labour before that.
                    <br><br>
                    It is an all-or-nothing strategy, where the prime minister will own the consequences, good or bad.
                    <br><br>
                    Economic growth is the prize they seek.
                    <br><br>
                    But they can't be certain their approach will work, nor the methods they have chosen to deliver it will be popular.
                    <br><br>
                    And then there are the side effects.</p>
